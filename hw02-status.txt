12. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Writing the calculator was actually really hard - took some outside
knowledge that was hard to wrap my mind around. Writing the factor

palindrome function was easy, but I have no idea how much effort
went into the boilerplate that Dr Tuck provided us.
